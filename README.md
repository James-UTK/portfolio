This project is a digital adaptation of Monopoly, developed as an object-oriented Python application with a PostgreSQL backend. It manages player data, properties, and spaces, including various in-game transactions like buying properties, paying rent, and improving property with custom enhancements. The interface supports game setup, turn-based play, and actions based on board position, such as property ownership changes, money adjustments, and elimination upon bankruptcy. Database design follows normalized principles to handle complex entity relationships between players, properties, and spaces, while object-oriented design supports game logic and player interactions.
